USES OF SER USOS DE SER

1. Ser is used to talk about time expressions involving days, dates, years and hours.

Ayer fue mi cumpleanos. It was my birthday yesterday.

2. Ser is used to describe the place a person is from or the material something is made of.

3. Ser is used to describe the essential qualities that define a person or thing and that are not likely
to change in the near future. These can be names, personality descriptions, physical descriptions,
occupations, personal relationships, and religion, among others.

El es Miguel, es amable, es alto, es ingeniero, es mi primo y es catdlico.

This is Miguel, he is kind, he is tall, he is an engineer, he is my cousin, and he is catholic.

Notice that the indefinite articles un, una, unos, and unas may not be used when talking about
occupations with ser. They're often only included if extra information following the occupation is
given. Compare the following:

Ella es doctora. She is a doctor.

Ella es una doctora que tiene vocacion por ayudar a sus pacientes.

She is a doctor who has a vocation to help her patients.

4. Ser is used to describe the action taken on something or someone. This structure is also referred
to as the passive voice (subject + verb ser + past participle + [agent]).

La sopa fue cocinada por la familia Sanchez. The soup was cooked by the Sanchez family.

USES OF ESTAR USOS DE ESTAR

1. Estar is used in some phrases that deal with time. In such expressions the emphasis is on the state
of affairs and roughly translates to How are we looking on time? or Where do we stand for time?.
éA qué dia estamos? Estamos a dia 23 de enero. What day is it today? It is January 23rd.

2. Estar is used to express the physical position or posture a person or thing is in.
Mi amiga esta sentada en el sofa. My friend is seated on the couch.

3. Estar is used to express the location where someone or something is permanently, temporarily, or
conceptually.

El cine esta en frente del supermercado. The movie theater is opposite the supermarket.
Exception! The location of an event or party is described using ser, not estar.

La fiesta es en mi casa. The party is at my house.

4. Estar is used to describe ongoing actions or to describe someone or something's state. To express
ongoing actions estar is followed by a present participle (such as lavando) and to express someone
or something's state estar is followed by a past participle (such as muerto).

Estoy lavando los platos sucios. |! am washing the dirty dishes.

Mi bisabuelo esta muerto. My great grandfather is dead.

Intriguingly, death in Spanish is seen as an ongoing action, not a permanent state, so estar is used to
talk about being dead.

5. Estar is used to describe physical and mental conditions. Things that are likely to vary over several
hours, days, or even years can fall into this category.

Estoy muy cansada esta manana. / am very tired this morning.

Los estudiantes estan confundidos con la gramatica. The students are very confused with the
grammar.

6. Estar is used to describe how a person is feeling at a certain moment.
Ella esta muy triste hoy. She is very sad today.

7. Estar is used to describe how food tastes.
Estos churros estan riquisimos. These churros are delicious.

jCuidado! When referring to food on a menu or the menu's selection of food itself, we use ser instead
of estar because we are instead making reference to food items that are static and don’t change. For
example:

La comida de este restaurante es deliciosa. The food in this restaurant is delicious.
