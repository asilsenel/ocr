PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

One of the main goals of the theory of PDEs is to express the unknown function of several
independent variables from an identity where this function appears together with its partial
derivatives. Mostly, t denotes the time variable, x,y,z,... stand for the spatial(dimensional)

variables.

The general PDE for an unknown function u = u(x, y, Z,t) can be written as
F(x, y, Z, t, U, Uy, Uy, Uz, Ut, Uxx, Uxy) Uyz, Uyts ) = 0

where (x,y,z) €0 C R®,t € 1, Nis a given domain in R? and/ C Risa time interval.

Problems from mathematics and physics
Differential equations describe many different physical systems, ranging form gravitation to
fluid mechanics. They are difficult to study, they usually have individual equation, which needs
to be analyzed as a separate problem.
A fundamental question for any PDE is the existence and uniqueness of a solution for
given boundary conditions. For nonlinear equations these questions are in general hard to

answer.

So here is the equation describing the problem and the problem is defined also by its boundary
and initial values or conditions. For example

Partial differential equations can be classified from various points of view.

e If time t is one of the independent variables of the function, then we can speak about
evolution equations.
e lf it is not the case (the equation contains only spatial independent variables), we can
speak about stationary equations.
“* The highest order of the derivative of the unknown function in the equation determines
the order of the equation.

e If the order is 1, then it is first order, other-wise it is high order PDEs.

¢¢ If all the coefficients of u are constants, then it will be PDE with constant coefficients;

0)

otherwise it will be PDE with variable coefficients.
> If the equation consists only of a linear combination of u and its derivatives (for
example, it does not contain products as uu, , U,Uy,y, etc ...), then it is called a linear

equation. Otherwise, it is a nonlinear equation.
A linear equation can be written symbolically by means of a linear differential operator L ,
i.e., the operator with the property
L(au + Bv) = aL(u) + BL(v)

where a, f are real constants and u, v are real functions.

> The equation

L(u) = 0
is called homogeneous ,
> the equation

L(u) = f

where f is a given function, is called nonhomogeneous . The function f represents the “right
hand side” of the equation.
Examples: Classify the following equations.

1. The transport equation in one spatial variable

Uz tu, = 0

2. The Laplace equation in three spatial variables

Uxy + Uyy + Uzgz = 0

3. The Poisson equation in two spatial variables

Uxy +Uyy = f » f=fuy)

The interaction is represented by the term wu? .
5. The diffusion equation in one spatial variable

6. The equation of the vibrating beam

SOLUTION of PDEs

A function u is called a solution of a partial differential equation if, when substituted (together

with its partial derivatives) into the equation, the latter becomes an identity.
It means that the function u must have all derivatives appearing in the equation.

If k is the order of the given partial differential equation, then by its solution we understand a
function of the class C” satisfying the equation at each point. In such a case, we can speak
about the classical solution of a PDE. If we solve, for example, the diffusion equation in one

Spatial variable, that is,
Uz = kuyy

which is of the second order, then its classical solution will be a C*-function, i.e., a function

having continuous partial derivatives up to the second order at all points (x, t) considered.

Thus, we require the existence and continuity of derivatives u,, and u,, that do not occur in

the equation at all.
Example 1. Let us try to find a function u = u(x, y) satisfying the equation
Uxx = 0

This problem can be solved by direct integration of the equation

We have obtained a solution for arbitrary functions f(y) and g(y). However, if we want to
talk about the classical solution, the functions f(y) and g(y) must be twice continuously

differentiable.
Example 2. Let us find for a function u = u(x, y, Zz) satisfying the equation
Uyy tu =0

This equation is similar with the ODE for the unknown function v = v(t)

when the general solution is a function

with arbitrary constants. The solution of the PDE will be

where f(x, z) and g(x,z) are arbitrary twice continuously differentiable functions.
Example 3. Let us search for a function u = u(x, y) satisfying the equation
Uxy = 0

If we integrate with respect to y , we find

When we integrate with respect to x, then

where F’ = f.
Consequently, the solution of any partial differential equation depends on arbitrary functions.
Example 4. Let us look for a function u = u(x, y) satisfying the equation
(Uxx)* + (Uyy)? = 0

From the equation, we can write that

Since the left-hand side is linear in x and the right-hand side is linear in y , we can say that
ha fe» G1» Gz are linear functions. So,

u(x,y) =axy+bx+cy+d

where a, b, c,d are arbitrary real numbers. The solution depends on four arbitrary constants

instead of two arbitrary function of one variable!
AUXILIARY CONDITIONS (BOUNDARY AND INITIAL CONDITIONS)

PDE does not provide sufficient information to enable us to determine its solution uniquely.

For the unique determination of a solution, we need further information.

Initial Conditions: Condition of the function to be solved for at a particular time.

For example, for the function u(x, t)
) Lage u(x, to) = f(x) or = = g(x) are initial conditions.
t=Co

2
Ex. —=4— __, u(x,0)=x

Here, highest derivative of u with respect to t is 1. So, we need 1 initial condition.

Boundary Conditions: Condition of the function to be solved for at a particular special
positions, generally on the edges of the domain where the PDE solves.

We have three types of boundary conditions:

> Dirichlet Boundary Condition
Function u is specified at the boundary.
Ex. If u(x,t), then u(0,t) = f,(t) is a Dirichlet boundary condition

If u(x, y, t), then u(0, y, t) = fo(y,t) is a Dirichlet boundary condition

> Neumann Boundary Condition
Spatial derivative of the function u is specified at the boundary.
Ex. If w(x, t), then u,(0, t) = g,(t) is a Neumann boundary condition

If u(x, y, t), then w,(0, y, t) = g2(y,t) is a Neumann boundary condition

s ~The number of initial conditions are the highest derivative of u with respect to t.

10
> Robin (Newton) Boundary Condition
A linear combination of the derivative of the function and the function itself is specified at the
boundary.

Ex. If w(x, t), then u,(0, t) + ku(0,t) = h(t) is a Robin boundary condition

*“* The needed boundary initial condition number is the sum of the orders of highest

partial derivative in each spatial variable.
Ex.
Ure + Uxxxx = O

For the solution, we need 2 initial and 4 boundary conditions.

CONSTRUCT OF A PDE

Let us consider the geometric surfaces of two parameters f (x, y, z,a, b) = 0 where a,b are
arbitrary parameters.

To determine the PDE, we have to take derivative of f with respect to x and y.
